# Installation

1. Git clone this repo somewhere
2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Click "developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and point it to your git repo

## It's installed, now what?

Go to [chrome://apps](chrome://apps) and you should have a Talker Fish that
loads talker in its own pane. Links clicked inside this pane will open in a
separate chrome window.

## That's it?

Copy the contents of `./plugins/notify.js` into a Talker Plugin and reload the
page, and now you'll get notificiations whenever someone posts in chat.
